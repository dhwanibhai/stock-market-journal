    <h3>Project Timeline</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>October 30:</strong> Brainstormed and finalized the idea for a stock market simulator. Outlined core functionalities, including real-time trading and portfolio tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>November 1:</strong> Installed essential development tools and libraries. Set up Git repository and project folder structure.</li>
        <li><strong>November 8:</strong> Developed a secure login system. Referenced GitHub repositories for inspiration.</li>
        <li><strong>November 12:</strong> Integrated AlphaVantage API for market data. Faced API key invalidation due to incorrect setup, delaying integration by a day.</li>
        <li><strong>November 15:</strong> Completed the main menu interface. Options included "Trade Stocks," "View Portfolio," and "Funds Management." Implemented a placeholder for live data updates.</li>
        <li><strong>November 18:</strong> Resolved a critical bug in user portfolio updates. Debugging revealed an issue with rounding errors in financial calculations.</li>
        <li><strong>November 20:</strong> Implemented the buy/sell functionality with real-time pricing. Calculated brokerage fees dynamically for each transaction. Encountered issues with delayed API responses causing transaction errors.</li>
        <li><strong>November 21:</strong> Optimized the trading algorithm for better performance. Identified a major bug where incorrect stock prices were being fetched due to time-zone differences.</li>
        <li><strong>November 23:</strong> Developed a funds management system, allowing users to deposit, withdraw, and view transaction history. Encountered data persistence issues during withdrawal operations.</li>
        <li><strong>November 25:</strong> Introduced stock trend graphs with interactive features. Users could compare up to three stocks simultaneously. Faced challenges in rendering graphs on older browser versions.</li>
        <li><strong>November 26:</strong> Attempted integration of AngelOne API but faced documentation issues. Switched to Zerodha API for â‚¹2000, which offered better support. <img src="transaction.png" alt="Transaction Screenshot" class="project-image"></li>
        <li><strong>November 27:</strong> Faced a system crash due to memory leaks in data retrieval functions. Implemented fixes to manage memory allocation more effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>November 28:</strong> Restructured codebase for scalability. Documented dependencies and workflows for team reference. Added unit tests for critical components.</li>
        <li><strong>November 29:</strong> Tested the system with mock data. Identified and fixed performance bottlenecks in data retrieval functions. Debugged an issue where large portfolios caused UI freezing.</li>
        <li><strong>November 30:</strong> Set up header files for modular programming. Debugged function calls and ensured smooth integration across modules. Fixed an issue with uninitialized variables causing random crashes.</li>
        <li><strong>December 1:</strong> Added a notification system to alert users about stock price fluctuations and market news. Encountered issues with duplicate notifications during peak market hours.</li>
        <li><strong>December 2:</strong> Debugged an infinite loop issue in the trade module. Improved error handling to prevent recurrence. Conducted stress testing with multiple simulated users.</li>
        <li><strong>December 3:</strong> Designed and launched this journal to showcase our project journey and highlight achievements. Faced CSS alignment issues during deployment.</li>
        <li><strong>December 5:</strong> Conducted a final round of testing and optimization. Prepared project for deployment and presentation. Encountered last-minute issues with API rate limits under heavy usage.</li>
